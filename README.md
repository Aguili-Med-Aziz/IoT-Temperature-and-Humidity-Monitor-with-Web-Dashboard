# IoT-Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitor-with-Web-Dashboard
This project is a complete embedded system that monitors environmental temperature and humidity, and sends the data to a cloud server for visualization. The system is based on a microcontroller (such as an Arduino or ESP32), integrates sensors and uses a simple web dashboard to display live sensor data.
